# _React Tap House_

#### _A sample site for a Tap House, 9/7/18_

#### _**Ryan Putman**_

## Description
_This is a recreation of a previous Angular site rebuilt in React. There is a different process going into planning out how to recreate this site. React is a new language for me. This project will be built over a two week period in two 8 hour segments. The second week will introduce more advanced features that will closer mimic the original Angular site._
_The data will be hardcoded into the app instead of using a database_
_The premise of the site is to create a functioning site for any type of beer, kombucha, coffee vendor._
_Stock levels and purchasing of different sizes of beers, including growlers will be possible._

## Unforeseen Issues & Questions
_Css Objects is limiting when it comes to hover effects or last of type selectors. I implemented css modules as a work around for such issues._
_Loading images was difficult but was able to implement url and file loader._
_Wanted a background image. All inside divs dont fill screen when the content is not very tall. Used a css module on the app root but then couldnt load a loaded image. Used a remote version of the image for now._
_Collect form data_
_Decrement object value based on selling of growler.
